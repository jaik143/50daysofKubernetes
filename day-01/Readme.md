# 🚀 Day 1 - Understanding Containers 🐳

Welcome to Day 1 of my **#50DaysOfKubernetes** challenge!  
Today, I focused on the foundational concept of **containers**, which power modern application deployment and orchestration using Kubernetes.

## 🔍 What I Learned

✔️ Understood how **containers differ from virtual machines**  
✔️ Explored **Docker** and the **container lifecycle**  
✔️ Learned why **containers enable consistent deployments** across environments

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Containers are lightweight, fast, and isolated environments to run applications.
- Unlike VMs, they share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient.
- Docker simplifies building, packaging, and distributing containerized apps.
- Containers eliminate the classic **“it works on my machine”** problem.
